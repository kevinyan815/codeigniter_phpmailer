This example shows the code integrating PHPMailer into CodeIgniter Framework.

CodeIgniter's Email class and PHP's `mail()` function both based on local mail server,
and to some group it's a little bit complicated to build their own mail server, so 
maybe PHPMailer is a appropriate choice .

More detail about PHPMailer please see their repository https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer


Usage example:

    //in controller or model, load this library
    $this->load->library('Mailer');
    
    $email = "address@example.com";
    $subject = "This is subject";
    $content_html = "&lt;div&gt;test code&lt;/div&gt;"
    
    //send mail using smtp
    //if you need set properties like 'cc', 'Bcc', 'replyTo'
    //you can set it directly like
    //$this->mailer->From ='';
    //$this->mailer->cc = '';
    //$this->mailer->replyTo ='';

    $this->mailer->smtp_send($email, $subject, $content_html);`


Hope this code will help you.
